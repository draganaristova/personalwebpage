        <p>Everyone has their own hobbies, something that makes them happy. It is mine, to make my own library that will be
            supplemented with a different book every day. Reading books makes me happy and fulfilled. When I want to have a relaxed day then reading
            is the right decision. I have several favorite writers like Lisa Claypas, Lucinda Riley, Sarah Gio. But I can choose Colleen Hoover
            who is really wonderful and innovative in writing.</p>
        <p class="second">These are my favorite books by her that I can read all the time without getting bored. Each book has a special place on my shelf.</p>
